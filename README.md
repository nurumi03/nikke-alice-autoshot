# Nikke Alice Autoshot

A code that I used to auto alice's shots.

## Dependences

This script depends on [interception][interception_repo] and [pyinterception][pyinterception_repo] libraries.

I use [pyinput][pyinput_repo] to implement a "stop" command. You can install this dependency as well or create your own logic to stop the script.

To enable Alice's shots to start/stop, I compiled this code with [pyinstaller][pyinstaller_repo] to create a start command using a Logitech Pro mouse, but you can explore other methods.

## Develpment

Feel free to clone this repo or use the code as you see fit. You can use this repository as an example of how to automate clicks in _Nikke: Goddess of Victory_.
